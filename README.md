# Welcome to Buggy Land :))
In this directory, you shall find that so many modules (*.c) contain many vulnerabilities.

Your tasks are to find some tools to detect them all and fix them.
Some will be found by scanning tool while others require you to fuzz them.

For Static Security Scanning, you have to scan all two tracks. For fuzzing, you can choose track 1 or track 2.
